Improve the ``--stepwise``/``--sw`` flag to not forget the last failed test in case pytest is executed later without the flag.

This enables the following workflow:

1. Execute pytest with ``--stepwise``, pytest then stops at the first failing test;
2. Iteratively update the code and run the test in isolation, without the ``--stepwise`` flag (for example in an IDE), until it is fixed.
3. Execute pytest with ``--stepwise`` again and pytest will continue from the previously failed test, and if it passes, continue on to the next tests.

Previously, at step 3, pytest would start from the beginning, forgetting the previously failed test.

Also added the new ``--stepwise-reset``/``--sw-reset``, allowing the user to explicitly reset the stepwise state and restart the workflow from the beginning.
